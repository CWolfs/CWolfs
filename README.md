### 👋 Hey there 👋

I'm Richard and I design and develop 'things'.

I've been developing for over 16 years so worked as a backend developer, frontend developer, fullstack and games developer. You'll often see me making mods and open source tools for games too. I'm a problem solver.

### ⚡ Impressive things ⚡

- [Mission Control Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtYc59cSXeI) - Built a mission editor for BattleTech as an in-game mod. This involved years of work to slowl piece together the mission format and inject extensive user interface into the game to allow for an editor flow with validation.

- [ConverseTek](https://github.com/CWolfs/ConverseTek) - Reverse engineered binary conversation files for BattleTech and created a nice-to-use tool for creating/editing them. The only way for modders to be able to create any conversation of this type.

- [React-Native-Keychain Contribution](https://github.com/CWolfs/react-native-keychain) - Contributed to React-Native-Keychain to add support for a new form of RSA padding (OAEP) & fix Android KeyStore unlock timeout issues related to biometrics
